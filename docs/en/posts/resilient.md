# Stress
* stress is unavoidable and a universal phenomenon.
* we're prewired and hardwired with it. we call it fight or flight response

## the definition of stress
* knock us out of homostatic balance`it's something that knocks you out of being calm, rested, and in an ideal state of being.`
* how do our brains and bodies respond to stress
  * the amygdala get activated
    * This is kind of emotion center of our brain
    * This is what communicates to the rest of the body when something actually is a stressor
  * The frontal lobes no longer perform its duties
    * for good decision-making,
    * rational thought
  * two pieces of the autonomic nervous system as the stress response
    * the sympathetic nervous system`the gas pedal`
    * the parasympathetic response`the brake`

* we have to learn how to silence the sympathetic nervous system by activating this parasympathetic response
* how dose stress actually operate on us differently than on a zebra
  * our frontal lobe`you're in a hightened level of stress, even though noting's occurred`
  * this can create kind of chronic stress/toxic stress

* Yerkes-Dotson curve

### chronic stress
* Chronic stress produces a wear and tear on our bodies minds and behavior
  * bodies
  * minds`the stress response causes us become even more sensitive, in terms of our emotional responding`
  * behavior`they're more likely to be agitated and upset and act aggresively or angrily towards others`

* The modern day in mental health is now that it exists on two continuum
  * distress or stress`what are we doing to manage stress`
  * a quality of life,or wellness`what are we doing to optimize our quality of life and well being`

>压力不可避免，并不总是有害。
但要非常注意长期性压力，首先是要注意到自己的状态
从身体健康、日常行为以及小决策上就可以很容易观察到是否处于压力状态

## resilience
* the defind of resilience 
  * surviving 
  * thrive

* resilience is a combination of ingredients
  * mindfulness-based practices
  * values clarification and commitment
  * purposefully cultivate positive emotions
  * connecting with others in very meaningful ways

> 韧性包括两个概念：压力管理和自洽。自洽即把好的要素放进生活习惯里
从一个好的决策起点，会带来其他积极的决策
举例来说，我从前很不喜欢打扫屋子，因为没有理由。后来，我买了ns，健身环大冒险，很好玩。因为运动，需要摩擦力，地滑就买了瑜伽垫。瑜伽垫收起来，就会带上地上的灰尘，所以，打扫屋子就变成每次游玩的必要。随后因为占用了时间，又变成了一个休息的时间。现在打扫屋子变成了生活的一部分，我仍然不是喜欢打扫，而且我需要打扫，并不妨碍。

# Values
>identifying doing what matters most in life
## the define of values
* Values are chosen life past, or directions
* They're not something that you achieve or cross off on a list
* an example of changing poopy diapers
  * it can seem annoying, frustrating
  * you see it as that you're being a caring, loving parent
* values are all about being the person you want to be, doing what matters most to you in life.

* misunderstanding of Values
  * confuse goals and values`love for learning/earn a degree`

* Values' function
  * They guide your daily actions`Why do you get up and do what you do`
  * They help us with our decisions

* The factors that eats away with our ability to live consistent with our values
  * stress`accept stress as being a part of life`
  * multitask
  * so much happens

> 我要成为一个才华横溢的人，为了这个目标就要一，二，三……


### doing what matters most
1. figure out what are the domains of values`roles in our life`
   * brother, son, father
   * Who do I want to be
2. specific actions
3. live consistent with who you want to be
4. do what matters most
5. staying committed to them

* the bullseye activity
  * clarifying your values and certain domains
    * work or education
    * relationship
    * personal growth and health
    * leisure and recreation
  * really estimating where you're at on your dartboard
  * really find barries
  * really do the work to identify what those values directed behaviors are
* The most important part is the commitment part
* That is commit to doing what matters most.

>1. 讲价值观和任务优先级的问题，从抽象的概念，变成具体的行为。
但是优先级的问题并没有讲太多，其实是分成紧急的任务和重要的任务，后面还会讲无意识的任务。总之，优先级这个问题很难啦。记住紧急的事情，拖一拖就可能成为不用做的事情
>2. 观察自己，从具体的四类上来观察自己行为，是不是在让自己感觉到变好，不做事情和做什么同样重要

# Awareness

## mindlessness
* our natural tendency is to behave mindlessly or think in a mindless manner
* They can be harmful to others and actually cause more stress on ourselves
* mindlessness consists of behaving in a reactive and emotional manner
* mindlessness is about being stuck in the past and future`not in the present moment`
* multitasking`a real example`

## mindfulness
* In mindfulness, you need three elements to combine to create mindfulness.
  * purposeful awareness`pay attation on purpose to what is happening internal--that is, within us`
  * An open and gentle attitude`just observe without any judgment`
  * Intentionality or agency`purposefully choosing to do what's most effective`

* five specific mindfulness-based practices
  * mental clarify
  * a life de-stressor
  * the mindful stop
  * mindful daily routine
  * mindful breathing

>多线程操作，依靠情绪反应，陷入回忆和空想，都是无意识行为，无形中会创造压力(12点了，开始网抑云音乐)。
首先是要mute everything，开始认真的观察，以及选择


# Pay attention to the positive
## what is attention
* attention
  * take possession of our mind
  * the focal point of our consciousness
  * all the different things that are happening around you right now, but you're pay attention to something specific

* the radio is way in favor of paying more attention to the nagitive then the positive
* our natural tendency actually works against us, and cause us more distress than good.

* The tendency for nagitive attention actually has implications for how we feel, the meaningfulness we get out of life, and ultimately, how we behave in life.

### gain control of attention
* selective attention`honing in one thing at exclusion of everthing else going on`
* we may not be able to control what captivate our attention, but through awareness, we can notice that we're paying attention to something negative, and dive our attention to something that's more positive and uplifting

> 注意力？关注点？这里是讲引起注意的事务，而不是讲专注。
> 我们无法决定什么会引起我们注意（大概吧），但是可以决定我们怎么看待。或者说是如何处理。比方说，弥漫悲观情绪的新闻，你是直接选择不看呢？选择数学工具分析样本，选择实地考察，还是杞人忧天。
 
### attention practice 
>choosing to pay attention to the positive
1. seaching for the silver lining
   * people in some of the most troublesome circumstances still have the ability to find the small things`sunrise,wildlife`
2. choosing to see the positive in others`inspire, admire`
3. developing positive go-to staples`vacation`

## gratitude
> a specific type of paying attention to our lives

* gratitude is really more of a feeling

### cultivate and practice
* you gotta actually belive it and intentionally practice it. 
* more than just saying, you ask a deeper question
  * it's not just who or what happened, and it's why you're grateful
  * thinking about the absence of a positive event

* practice
  * weekly gratitude journaling
    1. reflect on your week and you want to identify five things for which you are grateful for, or was a surprise in positive way, that happened
    2. why you are grateful for that event
  * more of an ongoing thing that you can do 
    * writing thank you notes 
  * doing a gratitude letter or visit

> 思想问题是首要问题，你必须相信感谢训练是有用的，以及亲自去实践，比如写周报，记录一些很好的事情，甚至于对特定人进行感谢活动。制造一把全新的锤子。


# Emothion
>manage intense nagative emotions and cultivating positive ones

## what they are
* Emotions actually serve many vital purposes such as learning, development of memories, our ability to communicate, gain information about our environments and ultimately motivate us
* Emotion is subjective experience that combines our body reaction and cognitive reactions
* Emotions are in response to a real or imagined event or object, are designed to give us information about those real or imagined events or objects
* Emotions fundamentally motivate us to take certain types of behaviors or actions

* Emotions can be classified as either negative or positive
  * Negative:it restricts our attention and ultimately narrows our behavior
    * Anxiety: narrowing your focus to actually solve that issue at hand
    * Anger: protect our self or defend our self
  * positive: broadening our attention and broadening our behavios 
    * Pride: greater confidence, more likely to commit to taking on additional things

    * identifying and labeling it 
      * saying something to the effect `I'm experiencing anger, fear`
    * remind yourself, I'm not the emotion I'm experiencing, and this too shall pass
  * hitting the relaxation response or doing something purposefully to become relaxed
    * guided imagery through the five senses, progressive muscle relaxation, and what we call deep breathing 
  * the use of distraction tactics 
    * engage in activities
    * contributing`do something for someone else`
    * comparision`who may be in worse circumstance`

## Positve emotions

  1. the broaden impact`broaden people's attention and thinking`

  4. the undo impact of negative emotions

* how we actually cultivate positive emotions
  * intentionally focus on the small positive things in life
  * do for others
  * engage in activities
  * connecting with others in certain types of ways
